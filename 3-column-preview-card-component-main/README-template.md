## My process
Before i started the project i looked closely at the layout and also the looks of the project and then i broke it down into pieces. Though i had prblem with implementing the button animation so i used hover states to replicate it but i would have love to implement in using animation

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learnt more about the root property and also adding hover pseudo class to elements


.btn:hover {
    color: var(--clr-neutral-2);
    background: none;
}


### Continued development

I would love to focus more on Flexbox and Grid in future projects
